# The Complete Android Oreo Developer Course
In October 2019 I [completed](https://udemy-certificate.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/UC-S3HAZ49R.pdf) this course in native Android development with Java and Kotlin, and became a certified[[1]](CCA-Certificate-Java-Level-1-Sebastian-Lundquist.pdf)[[2]](CCA-Certificate-Java-Level-2-Sebastian-Lundquist.pdf) Java developer in the process! The course was taught by Rob Percival and Nick Walter. This post showcases the projects developed alongside the course.

## Uber Clone
This app allows the user to login as either a rider to request for an Џвєг or a driver to accept nearby requests. The rider gets notified when their request has been accepted and can follow the driver on the map. The driver sees where the rider is on the map, and gets directions when the request is accepted. This app expands upon many concepts previously taught in the course, focusing on Google Maps functionality and Parse server storage and authentication.
